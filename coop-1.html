            Keypath Education is an education consulting, design and development
            company. They partner with various universities across the world and
            help them design their courses, and provide template or custom
            interactive web elements to help improve the student experience.
            These interactives can range from a practice quiz for students to
            test their understanding, to a poll that returns the data to the
            faculty to use in a lecture, to a scientific interactive diagram of
            the human heart. Anything more complicated than text or an image is
            likely to be handled by Keypath on one of their partnered sites.

            At Keypath Education, I was a Front-end Developer. That means that I
            was responsible for building interactives, as well as fixing bugs or
            adding new features in preexisting interactive templates. Most of
            the skills that were needed for this job were learned at work,
            through some short training courses and gradual increases in the
            difficulty of work, in order to facilitate improvement. A typical
            interactive task would have me interacting with an Instructional
            Designer to receive details on a requested interactive, and then
            develop it for a few days until it’s near completion. That would be
            followed by a period where the ID will test and make requests for
            changes, which would be fulfilled until the ID is completely happy
            with the product. It would then be their responsibility to implement
            it into a course and present it to the university partner.

            My goals range from the small to the large. For any one project, I

            questions like “How can I reduce the DOM operations here?” or “Is
            there any way to make this HTML more semantic?” and try my best to
            comment wherever it makes sense. Below are my overarching goals for
            this work term, a description of how I accomplished it, and a
            reflection on what I think I can do to further it in the future.

                One of my major goals for this position was to improve my
                technical abilities when it comes to web development. I hadn't
                had much experience in web technologies up until the start of
                this co-op, with just one academic website project under my
                belt. Through working as a frontend developer, I gained
                important knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, as
                well as JQuery. I also made a few interactive pieces that used a
                database component in order to log comments and responses from
                users. I am now confident in my ability to use the basic web
                technologies to create just about anything, however if there was
                something that I’d still like to improve it would be to get more
                comfortable using third party libraries to enhance my skills
                further, such as Bootstrap, React, or Angular. This is so that I
                can have more versatility in what I am able to work on, and
                potentially use the best method to solve any problem.

                The goal of improving my ability to create accessible websites
                is one that developed midway through my work at Keypath.
                Accessibility is an aspect of design that I never had to
                consider up until starting this position in September 2021. As
                Keypath is involved in education, it is imperative for all of
                their work to be accessible for all users. As such, I had to
                consider multiple forms of input and output, including keyboard
                navigation, screen reader usage and colour contrast. I strived
                to make all my pieces at least AA WCAG compliant, or AAA if
                possible, which was always verified by my supervisors who were
                experts when it comes to accessibility. Much like my goal about
                my technical ability, I am confident that I can make most web
                pages accessible, so long as they use just the standard web
                technologies. This means that I would like to learn to use
                accessibility libraries, or learn how to make websites built on
                different frameworks accessible.

                As this was my first co-op, as well as my first professional
                experience writing code, I made it a goal to learn about how
                developers are expected to organize themselves and work. At
                Keypath I used various Atlassian work related softwares in order
                to track my time and stay organized. This ranged from Jira to
                manage tasks, to Tempo which helped track my time. This was also
                my first time using git alongside other people. I learned how to
                make and review pull requests, and resolve merge conflicts when
                they came up. I now understand how to partake in an agile
                workflow, and use business software to organize myself, which
                should be abundantly helpful in coming work terms, and beyond
                graduation.

                Another one of my major goals for this co-op position was to
                familiarize myself with working alongside other developers. In
                all of my academic career up until this point, I hadn't once had
                to collaborate with another person on code. However, as I was a
                member of the development team at Keypath, collaboration was
                impossible to avoid. I learned how to submit my own code in the
                form of a pull request, as well as review other people's pull
                requests. On top of that, regular meetings and code
                presentations ensured that I would constantly interact with
                other team members, and have a chance to share my insight, as
                well as receive recommendations from them.

            I hope that after reading this page that you can see how far I’ve
            come since the beginning of this work term. Coming from a student

            expectations of working in a professional coding environment. As
            such, I believe that I have the capability to fit any front-end
