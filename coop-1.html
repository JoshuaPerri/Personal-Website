          For my first co-op position, I worked as a frontend developer at
          Keypath Education. Keypath is a company that develops interactive
          elements for university courses. Basically, they develop anything more
          complicated than simple text on a page that you might see in an online
          university course. This can range from a click-to-reveal course
          element, to a practice quiz to test a student's knowledge or even a
          poll that returns that data to the faculty using a database.

                When I had started at Keypath I knew that my technical abilities
                would be tested. I hadn't had much experience in web
                technologies up until that point, with just one website project
                under my belt. Through working as a frontend developer, I gained
                important knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, as
                well as JQuery. I also made a few interactive pieces that used a
                database component in order to log comments and responses from
                users. I feel like I got a good sampling of what skills are
                required for a frontend developer position, having experienced
                both the design and the functional side of making the front end
                of a website.

              <p class="goal-paragraph">
                Accessibility is an aspect of design that I never had to
                consider up until starting this position in September 2021. As
                Keypath is involved in education, it is imperative for all of
                their work to be accessible for all users. As such, I had to
                consider multiple forms of input and output, including keyboard
                navigation, screen reader usage and colour contrast. I strived
                to make all my pieces at least AA WCAG compliant, or AAA if
                possible, which was always verified by my supervisors who were
                experts when it comes to accessibility. If you have the means to
                test accessibility compliance yourself, you can test this page,
                which is keyboard navigable and screen reader ready.

                Throughout my time at Keypath, I had to use various Atlassian
                work related softwares in order to track my time and stay
                organized. This ranged from Jira to manage tasks, to Tempo which
                helped track my time. This was also my first time using git in a
                professional setting, as well as using it alongside other
                people. I learned how to make and review pull requests, and
                resolve merge conflicts when they came up.

                In all of my academic career up until this point, I hadn't once
                had to collaborate with another person on code. However, as I
                was a member of the development team at Keypath, collaboration
                was impossible to avoid. I learned how to submit my own code in
                the form of a pull request, as well as review other people's
                pull requests. On top of that, regular meetings and code
                presentations ensured that I would constantly interact with
                other team members, and have a chance to share my insight, as
                well as receive recommendations from them.
